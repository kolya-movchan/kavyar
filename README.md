# Kav'yar

## ☕️ Intro
“Kav’yar” is an Ukrainian website that will help the users to easily search a perfect coffee shop in key towns of Ukraine. The website offers a big variety of filtering options and a possibility to sort coffee shops by the price of its products. Also, users can add their favourite coffee shops to the favourites category, so they can easily follow the updates of their beloved places.

## 📌 Short Description
The project consists of two parts: an admin panel and a user-facing platform.

The admin panel provides a reliable and secure platform that ensures a seamless user experience. It is divided into several main sections: cities, features, categories, products, and coffee shops.

The user-facing platform of Kav'yar is more than just a tool to help people find the perfect coffee shop. It is a platform that fosters community and encourages conversation in a comfortable and welcoming environment. Kav'yar offers opportunities for revenue through partnerships, sponsorships, and advertising.
